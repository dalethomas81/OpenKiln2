OpenKiln2
=========

### About

This project is a reimagination of the [OpenKiln](https://github.com/dalethomas81/OpenKiln) project.  

The original OpenKiln required a large infrastructure to run including a dedicated MSSQL server, Node-RED server, and Grafana server.    

The goal of OpenKiln2 is to run all of the above services on a single Raspberry Pi.
